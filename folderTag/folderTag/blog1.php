        When AI unites with AV
      </h2>

      <p class="mb" style="line-height: 29px;">
       Intelligence is like love; we can't have enough of it," says Paul Grey. Artificial intelligence is being amplified day by day. The scientists are paid millions to develop a novel technique that stands out in the crowd. Artificial intelligence is one of the best science and technology  that humans have in the 21st century.
AI has an integral role to play in AV products. No one likes pressing buttons, fixing wires, or being involved in the hassle when it comes to watching movies, attending lectures, using speakers, etc. AV products are now equipped with Bluetooth and wireless facilities, a step ahead in the technology world. Wireless processes are more convenient, user-friendly, and fast. Documents can be shared within seconds, work is more secure, and anyone and everyone can operate the gadgets that were once gruelling. Banks, education institutions, public sectors, corporations the list is endless. Everyone is embracing the meeting of AI and AV. As AI gathers more data and exports that data directly into analysis tools, teams can focus on work requiring human talent and expertise, leaving repetitive processes far behind.

        Whether we talk about Alexa playing music or Google searching data on our voice command, everything is AI. When AI stepped into the human world, it was a cup of tea for the elites. But with the progress of technology, it is being made available to everyone, which makes it unique in today's time.

   Samsung is investing more in its SmartThings smart home automation system by growing its ecosystem as well as its capability to serve customers. SmartThings products can connect with intelligent assistants like Bixby, Google Home, and Alexa, further connecting more and more gadgets and thus forming a cross-link. This union will become stronger with the advancement of technology. AI is a revolution, and it might invade everything we utilise. We cannot imagine how it will affect our lives in the future.
